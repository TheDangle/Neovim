# 🪓 Neovim of the Norns

> _“Runes carved, spells sung, and keys mapped — may the code of Yggdrasil guide your edits.”_

Welcome, wanderer! This is my **Neovim configuration** — forged in the fires of Muspelheim, refined by Odin’s wisdom, and now shared with the brave. This repository serves as the heart of my text editing rituals, tuned for efficiency, aesthetics, and power.

## 🌌 Purpose

This repository exists to house my **personal Neovim setup** — a configuration designed for development across various realms (Rust, Lua, TypeScript, etc.). It includes settings, keymaps, plugins, and more. Feel free to explore, fork, or contribute if you are a fellow warrior of the terminal.

## 🐺 Installation

### 1. Slay the Old Config

If you already have a Neovim config you wish to replace, back it up or move it:

```sh
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.backup
````

### 2. Clone This Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
```

> 🔮 *Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.*

### 3. Launch the Realm

```sh
nvim
```

Neovim should now open with your custom setup. If it uses a plugin manager (like [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim), [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim), etc.), it may auto-install plugins on first launch.

## ⚔️ Features

* ⚡ **Fast startup** thanks to lazy loading
* 🌙 **Dark-mode aesthetics** worthy of Helheim
* 🧠 **LSP & Autocompletion** to rival Mimir’s wisdom
* 🔍 **Fuzzy finding** via telescope and live grep
* 🌀 **Treesitter syntax** — code structure as strong as Yggdrasil
* 🧙 **Custom keymaps** forged by runes for faster workflow

## 🛠 Requirements

* `neovim` ≥ 0.9
* `git`
* `curl`, `ripgrep`, `fd`, etc. depending on plugin needs
* Nerd Font (for icon support in UI)

## 🏛 Structure

```bash
~/.config/nvim/
├── init.lua        # Entry point for the configuration
├── lua/
│   ├── core/       # Basic settings and keymaps
│   ├── plugins/    # Plugin configs
│   └── ...         # Additional modules
```

> The structure may differ slightly depending on the config style (Lua-based or legacy `init.vim`).

## 🐉 Contributing
